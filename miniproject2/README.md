# Mini Project 2: Grade Prediction 

Given grades and students statistics from moodle, can we predict grade?

Since we are given the entire grades, the task is quite trivial so more questions are asked to make the project more challenging.

Instructions and data used can be requested from the author.

Therefore, 2 main questions are asked.

1. How good can machine learning algorithm capture human heuristics as dimension increases.
2. How accurate can we predict student's grade using data mid-course

1 sub questions is further asked
1. Does the existence of irrelevant 0 grade groups impact the accuracy and there the analysis of the result.

report.pdf will paint the clear picture of the results.
